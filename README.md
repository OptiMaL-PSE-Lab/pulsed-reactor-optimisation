This repository contains a number of projects concerned with the optimisation of operating conditions and characteristics of helical tube reactors. 

The first project ```pulsed-reactor-optimisation``` aims to optimise the geometric parameters and operating conditions of a computational fluid dynamics model of a pulsed flow helical tube reactor. More information can be found within the project's README.
